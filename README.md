## EcoFootprint.AI ##

EcoFootprint.AI is an AI-powered Streamlit web application designed to help users **predict, track, visualize, and reduce their digital carbon footprint**. By analyzing activities like streaming, video calls, and email usage, the app calculates estimated CO₂ emissions and offers **smart eco-friendly suggestions, gamification badges, and interactive visualizations** to encourage a greener digital lifestyle.

# Key Features

- Live Carbon Emission Calculator
   Input usage of platforms like YouTube, Zoom, Gmail, etc.
   Real-time CO₂ estimation based on scientifically-backed emission factors.

- Save & Compare History
   Save daily/weekly usage and track environmental impact over time.
   View comparisons between past and present emissions.

- Dynamic Visualizations
   Interactive line charts, bar graphs, and pie charts.
   Trend analysis and footprint breakdown by category.

- Gamification & Eco Badges
   Get rewarded with digital eco-badges for eco-friendly behavior.
   Avatar reactions change based on your performance (happy, neutral, sad).

- ML-Based Suggestions Engine
   Recommends personalized eco-tips using a trained machine learning model.
   Learns from your habits to suggest optimal changes.

- "What If" Simulator
   Simulate the impact of behavior changes (e.g., reducing Zoom hours).
   Compare actual vs hypothetical CO₂ output.

- Downloadable Eco Report Card (PDF)
   Generate and download a customized sustainability report.
  Includes tips, badges, charts, and historical summary.
